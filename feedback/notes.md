## Specification

1. README - not done

   - Get in the habit of writing README's for every project, you can also add more to this one.
   - Add in the link to your Figma design
   - If you are adding links in a md file you can do it like this [example link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) rather than a URL

2. BRANCHING - done

   - Nice work on this, one thing to consider is when you go onto a larger project you wil be creating feature branches which are focused on that one feature. Give this a go a branch is a feature you are adding.

3. SCSS - done / to work on

   - Try breaking your scss files down even more. e.g break your layouts into components.

4. Mobile First - done

5. 25 commits - close

6. BEM - done

## Overall

As I said during the demo I think you have relished the chance to apply what we covered in the morning into your project. Kudo's for that. You have a design that matches your figma and thats rad! I am going to give you some constructive feedback to take on to this project and to take forward to your next projects.

## To work on

It is a great project, only little things to take forward to the next projects.

- Update ReadME
- Move the CSS file so it is on the same level as the index.html

With SCSS:

- Have a look at the SCSS [7-1 docs](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture)
- Break your layouts into components
